Git allows only one branch/only one repository to be checked out from the repository at a given moment in time.

Git status is key - kepp checking your git status to make sure that everything is good

Git makes discrete pictures of the changes that you make to a file - not full copies of the file inclusive of the changes

The Head refers to the current file that is being worked on
