Notes on  git remotes:

- setting up is not necessarily intuitive
- I would like to double check my github account for password and security options
- I am going to review git and githib on treeouse and code acadmey yo make sure I have the basics down before the Foundaitons II course



Git allows only one branch/only one repository to be checked out from the repository at a given moment in time.

Git status is key - kepp checking your git status to make sure that everything is good

Git makes discrete pictures of the changes that you make to a file - not full copies of the file inclusive of the changes

The Head refers to the current file that is being worked on

git init: initializes a new empty git repo

git log: shows history of commits

git status: shows status of current git repe and suggests things to do
git add - stage cahgnes for commits or adds them to the index

git branch: creates a new branch

git commit: takes snapshot of the current state of the code

git checkout: switches branches

got config: sets configuration values of git
